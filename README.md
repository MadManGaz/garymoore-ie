# garymoore.ie Simple static website üåç

This is my personal website. For now it's a simple combo of HTML + CSS. I want to get a static site generator on the go to publish a blog.

Right now, this is effectively a placeholder. Hosted on Azure as a static web app and cached with the Cloudflare on the free plan for almost free web hosting.
